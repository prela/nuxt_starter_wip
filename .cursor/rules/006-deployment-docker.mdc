# Docker containerization and Coolify deployment standards

## Docker Best Practices
- ALWAYS use multi-stage builds for production images
- ALWAYS use specific version tags, never 'latest'
- ALWAYS implement proper health checks
- ALWAYS run containers as non-root user
- ALWAYS minimize image layers and size
- ALWAYS use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files

## Coolify Deployment Standards
- ALWAYS implement proper environment variable management
- ALWAYS use secrets for sensitive configuration
- ALWAYS implement proper logging for production debugging
- ALWAYS configure proper resource limits
- ALWAYS implement graceful shutdown handling

## Production Configuration
- ALWAYS enable production optimizations in Nuxt config
- ALWAYS implement proper SSL/TLS configuration  
- ALWAYS configure proper CORS policies
- ALWAYS implement rate limiting for APIs
- ALWAYS set up proper monitoring and alerting

## Example Dockerfile Structure:
[Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile)

## Hetzner VPS Optimization

- IMPLEMENT proper backup strategies
- CONFIGURE monitoring for resource usage
- SET UP automated security updates
